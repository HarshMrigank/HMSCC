# 🧠 HMSCC — Harsh Mrigank’s Simple C Compiler

HMSCC is a **from-scratch compiler system** designed as a serious **final-year engineering project**, demonstrating both **compiler internals** and **real-world system integration**.

The project intentionally prioritizes **correctness, clarity, and architectural separation** over gimmicks or over-engineering.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**HMSCC (Harsh Mrigank’s Simple C Compiler)** is a custom-built compiler for a C-like language. The system covers the *entire compilation pipeline* — from lexical analysis to executable output — and exposes the compiler safely through a **backend API** and **web-based interface**.

> 🎯 The goal is to demonstrate *deep understanding of compiler design and deployment*, not to compete with GCC/Clang.

## ✨ Key Features (Current)

### 🔹 Compiler (C++)

* ✅ Custom **Lexer** (Tokenizer)
* ✅ Recursive-descent **Parser**
* ✅ **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** construction
* ✅ **Semantic Analysis** (symbol table, scope, type checks)
* ✅ **Code Generation** (HMSCC → C)
* ✅ Control flow: `if / else`, `while`
* ✅ Data types: `int`, `string`
* ✅ Relational operators: `< > <= >= == !=`
* ✅ Robust syntax & semantic error reporting

### 🔹 Backend (Node.js)

* ✅ HMSCC compiled as a **standalone native binary**
* ✅ Compiler executed via **Node.js backend**
* ✅ `/compile` API returns:

  * Program output (stdout)
  * Compiler/runtime errors (stderr)
  * Generated C code
* ✅ Execution sandboxed using temporary directories
* ✅ Timeout-based protection against infinite loops
* ✅ Stateless, backend-first architecture

### 🔹 Frontend (Phase 8)

* ✅ Clean web-based interface
* ✅ Browser editor for HMSCC source code
* ✅ Compile & run via backend API
* ✅ Displays output, errors, and generated C code
* ✅ Strict separation from compiler logic
